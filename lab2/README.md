# Themes and styles

# Instructions

This laboratory explores creating custom themes and styles for both R
(ggplot2) and Python (matplotlib and seaborn). There are two laboratory
notebooks, one in R and one in Python. The instructor will demonstrate
from one of the two notebooks, but **you are required to read and
complete both notebooks** for this lab. You will follow the directions
in each to create custom themes within each notebook. For the Python
notebook, you will also create a matplotlib style file which will be
part of your submission for grade and completion. All submissions will
be via GitHub Classroom.

Once you clone the repo to your computer, you can open the `lab-r.html`
and `lab-python.html` pages in your browser to read through the
laboratory and see how to create your custom themes.

The final submission will be denoted by a git commit with the commit
message `final submission`. This will be what is evaluated for grade.
This must include:

- The file `lab-r.qmd` and the rendered notebook in HTML.
- The file `lab-python.qmd` and the rendered notebook in HTML.
- The matplotlib style file `my_style.mplstyle`

Files created during the rendering process, and files already in the
folder when you accept the assignment, are fine to keep in the
submission.

# Additional resources

We are developing supplementary resource pages on the website to help
you develop and understanding of themes and styles in data
visualization, in addition to class lectures.
